# AdoptMe-Trade-Freezer
⚠️ WARNING – The Freeze Stealer ⚠️
The Freeze Stealer is whispered about in the darkest corners of Adopt Me. It doesn’t just stop trades… it locks them in ice. One second you’re offering your dream pet, the next — frozen. Helpless. Then, like a flash of lightning, your inventory is stripped bare at light speed. Victims say they don’t even see it happen… only the chilling silence after their pets vanish.

"Once the Freeze Stealer targets you, there’s no escape. Blink — and it’s already too late."
